> This repository contains the implementation of our paper: **"DBConformer: Dual-Branch Convolutional Transformer for EEG Decoding"**, serving as a **benchmark codebase** for EEG decoding models. We implemented and fairly evaluated ten state-of-the-art EEG decoding models, including CNN-based, CNN-Transformer hybrid, and CNN-Mamba hybrid EEG decoding models.

## Overview
ðŸ“° News: **DBConformer** has been accepted for publication in the **IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (IEEE JBHI)**. The final version will be available soon. Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

ðŸ“° News: We've released the [supplementary material](https://github.com/wzwvv/DBConformer/blob/main/Supplementary_Material_for_DBConformer_final.pdf) for DBConformer.

ðŸ“° News! We've reproduced and added three recent EEG decoding baseline models, including [MSVTNet](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10652246), [MSCFormer](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-96611-5), and [TMSA-Net](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809424012473).

**DBConformer**, a **dual-branch convolutional Transformer** network tailored for EEG decoding:

- **T-Conformer**: Captures temporal dependencies
- **S-Conformer**: Models spatial patterns
- A **lightweight channel attention module** further refines spatial representations by assigning data-driven importance to EEG channels

## Features

- ðŸ”€ **Dual-branch parallel design** for symmetric spatio-temporal modeling
- ðŸ§© **Plug-and-play channel attention** for data-driven channel weighting
- ðŸ“ˆ **Strong generalization** across CO, CV, and LOSO settings
- ðŸ’¡ **Interpretable** aligned well with sensorimotor priors in MI
- ðŸ§® 8Ã— fewer parameters than large CNN-Transformer baselines (e.g., EEG Conformer)

Comparison of network architectures among CNNs (EEGNet, SCNN, DCNN, etc), traditional serial Conformers (EEG Conformer, CTNet, etc), and the proposed DBConformer. DBConformer has two branches that parallel capture temporal and spatial characteristics.

## Datasets
DBConformer is evaluated on **MI classification** and **seizure detection** tasks. MI datasets can be downloaded from [MOABB](https://moabb.neurotechx.com), and [NICU dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/4940267). The processed BNCI2014001 dataset can be found in [MVCNet](https://github.com/wzwvv/MVCNet).

  - BNCI2014001
  - BNCI2014004
  - Zhou2016
  - Blankertz2007
  - BNCI2014002
- Seizure Detection:
  - CHSZ
  - NICU

## Experimental Scenarios
DBConformer supports four standard EEG decoding paradigms:

- **CO (Chronological Order):** Within-subject, EEG trials were partitioned strictly based on temporal sequence, with the first 80% used for training and the remaining 20% for testing.
- **CV (Cross-Validation):** Within-subject, stratified 5-fold validation. The data partitions were structured chronologically while maintaining class-balance.
- **LOSO (Leave-One-Subject-Out):** Cross-subject generalization evaluation. EEG trials from one subject were reserved for testing, while all other subjectsâ€™ trials were combined for training.
- **CD (Cross-Dataset)**: Cross-dataset generalization evaluation. Training and testing were performed on distinct EEG datasets, e.g., training on BNCI2014001 and testing on BNCI2014004. The CD results are shown in Table S1 of the supplementary material.

## Visualizations
### Effect of Dual-Branch Modeling
To further evaluate the impact of dual-branch architecture, we conducted feature visualization experiments using t-SNE. Features extracted by T-Conformer (temporal branch only) and DBConformer (dual-branch) were compared on four MI datasets.

### Visualization of Spatio-Temporal Self-Attention
To further examine the interpretability of DBConformer, we visualized the self-attention matrices learned in both temporal and spatial branches on BNCI2014001, BNCI2014002, and OpenBMI datasets.

### Interpretability of Channel Attention
To investigate the interpretability of the proposed channel attention module, we visualized the attention scores assigned to each EEG channel across 32 trials (a batch) from four MI datasets. BNCI2014004 were excluded from this analysis, as it only contains C3, Cz, and C4 channels and therefore lacks spatial coverage for attention comparison.

### Sensitivity Analysis on Architectural Design
We further conducted a sensitivity analysis to explore how architectural design affects the DBConformer performance.
